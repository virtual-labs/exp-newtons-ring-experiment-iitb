<h3>Precaution</h3>

1. Glass plate & lens should be clean to avoid the presence of dust particles between them. <br>

2. The lens should be of large radius of curvature. <br>

3. The glass plate should be inclined at angle of 450 with an incident light. <br>

4. Cross wire should be focused tangentially on ring. <br>

5. The source should be an external source. <br>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

1. Find the least count of traveling microscope.   <br>

2. Arrange the apparatus as shown in fig so as to obtain Newton's ring.  <br>

3. Select the ring; say 1st and 2nd for determining their radius.  <br>

4. Set the vertical cross wire tangential to the 1st ring (left side first) Note down the readings.  <br>

5. Repeat the step (4) for 2nd ring (left side).  <br>

6. Set the cross wire on the 1st ring (Now on the ring side) & again note down the microscopic reading, repeat same procedure for 2nd ring (right side).  <br>

7. Calculate the wavelength of light used.  <br>
                                                                               |

<p> where,

MSR - Main Scale Reading.  <br>
VSR - Vernier Scale Reading.  <br>
TR - Total Reading.
