<h3>Precaution</h3>

<ol type='1'>

<li> Glass plate & lens should be clean to avoid the presence of dust particles between them. </li>

<li> The lens should be of large radius of curvature. </li>

<li> The glass plate should be inclined at angle of 450 with an incident light. </li>

<li> Cross wire should be focused tangentially on ring. </li>

<li> The source should be an external source. </li>

</ol>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<ol type='1'>

<li> Find the least count of traveling microscope.  </li>

<li> Arrange the apparatus as shown in fig so as to obtain Newton's ring.  </li>

<li> Select the ring; say 1st and 2nd for determining their radius.  </li>

<li> Set the vertical cross wire tangential to the 1st ring (left side first) Note down the readings.  </li>

<li> Repeat the step (4) for 2nd ring (left side).  </li>

<li> Set the cross wire on the 1st ring (Now on the ring side) & again note down the microscopic reading, repeat same procedure for 2nd ring (right side).  </li>

<li> Calculate the wavelength of light used.  </li>

</ol>

<p> where,

MSR - Main Scale Reading.  <br>
VSR - Vernier Scale Reading.  <br>
TR - Total Reading.
